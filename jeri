=== SPECIAL RULES ===

awareness		Rangers are only surprised on a roll of 1. This may mean that a ranger is able to act in the surprise round while their companions are surprised.
Foraging and Hunting	A party with a ranger succeeds at foraging with a 2-in-6 chance and finds prey when hunting with a 5-in-6 chance
Limited Possessions	A ranger may only keep wealth and possessions that can be kept on their person or mount. Excess must be donated to worthy causes (not other PCs!).
Pursuit			When the ranger’s party pursues an opposing group in the wilderness, the chance if evasion is reduced by 10%.
Stealth			In the wilderness, a ranger has a 3-in-6 chance of hiding and a 3-in-6 chance of moving silently.
Tracking		Rangers can identify and follow tracks. 20%
				may be modified by the following factors:
				Soft/hard ground: +20% to –50%.
				Size of group being tracked: +2% per creature beyond the first.
				Passing through an area where other tracks mingle: –50%.
				Age of tracks: –5% per 12 hours.
				Rainfall: –25% per hour.
				Efforts made to hide tracks: –25%.
